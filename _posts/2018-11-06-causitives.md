What`s it?

We use the passive or active causative for services that we want other people or places to do for us.

How does works?

Instead of using the verb "to be" + past participle, we use get or have + past participle in the passive voice.

Examples:

1)  I have to clean my car -> have to + principal verb
     I have KIWI clean my car -> have + place + P.V
     I have my car cleaned at KIWI -> have + object + past participle

In the example 1, the first sentence is written in ACTIVE VOICE using  have to + principal verb.

In the example 1, the second sentence is written in ACTIVE VOICE but we replace who does the action, in the first sentence the action is done by myself but in the second the action is done by other people or place, in this case is KIWI who did the action.

In the example 1, the third sentence is written in PASIVE VOICE because the "car" or my "car" is the receiver of the action, in this case the action is to clean.

Another Example:

2) I manicured my nails.
    I got marry to manicure my nails.
    I got my nails manicured by Marry

In the example 2, the first sentence is written in ACTIVE VOICE using past simple.

In the example 2, the second sentence is written in ACTIVE VOICE but using "got + doer+infinitive", in other words, we use that way to "get someone to do something for you".

In the example 2, the last sentence is written in PASSIVE VOICE because the intention is to express "get something done for you".
